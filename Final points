Linked List
	-know hot to traverse linked list
	-Know ho w to manipulate linked list
		- Reverse
		- remove duplicates
		- Merge two linked list
		- Sort
	-know hot to freee the removed node correctly
	-Know how to deal with head pointer correctly (double pointer)

Tree(recursion)
	-Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree
	-How to traverse: Pre-order, in-order, post-order
		Inorder:
			void inorder(node *root)
			{
				if(root == NULL)
				{
					return;
				}
				inorder(root->left);
				inorder(root->val);
				inorder(root->right);
			}
		-Know how to traverse with recursion
		-Know how to construct tree with recursion
		-Know how to manipulate tree.

		-Constructor
		-Destructor
			-Deallocate all the memory.
	-Understand inheritance
